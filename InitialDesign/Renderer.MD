##Initial Sketch

This is my first sketch.

![Class Diagram Sketch](https://github.com/NCCA/docwhite-CA1/blob/master/InitialDesign/class_diagram_sketch.png)

To start your project clone this repo into your home directory

``` 
git clone git@github.com:NCCA/[your username]-CA1.git

cd [your usrname]-CA1

```

You can then add your files and edit things. Once you are ready to upload (and do this often)

```
git add .
git commit -am "added files"
git push origin master
```
The commit message should make sence in the context of what you are doing such as modify certain files etc.
